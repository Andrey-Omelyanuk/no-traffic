Time Tracking:
1. 2 HOURS. I used my own project template, but I had to cut everything unnessary like authentication, notifications etc.
2. 1 HOUR.  For work with locations I had to update postgres with postgis. Finally I found ready to use docker image.
3. 2 HOUR.  Created models and API for it. Created test data. Something wrong with load fixtures. Used band-aid.
4. 2 HOUR.  Worked on UI components. I did not find good solusion how to parse location string, I did it manually.
5. 1 HOUR.  Worked on UI components. (see git history)
Work in progress.
